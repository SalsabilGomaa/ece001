        <h3> What Is the Purpose of an Operating System? <h3> 
            <p> Operating systems contain and manage all the programs and applications that a computer or mobile device is able to run, which means managing the deviceâ€™s software and hardware functions. The functions of an OS include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Booting: Booting is the process of turning on the computer and powering up the system. <br>
                </li><li>Memory management: This feature controls and coordinates the computer applications while allocating space for programs.<br>
                </li><li>Loading and execution: Your OS will load, or start up, a program and then execute the program so that it opens and runs.<br>
                </li><li>Data security: A good OS includes features that keep your data safe and computer programs secure. Security features are set up to keep unwanted cyberattackers at bay.<br>
                </li><li>Disk management: This manages all the drives installed in a computer, including hard drives, optical disk drives, and flash drives. Disk management can also be used to divide disks, format drives, and more.<br>
                </li><li>Process management: Your OS is designed to allocate resources to different computer processes, enable the processes to share information, protect them, and synchronize them. <br>
                </li><li>Device controlling: Your OS will allow you to open or block access to devices like removable devices, CD/DVDs, data transfer devices, USBs, and more.<br>
                </li><li>Printing controlling: As an extension of device controlling, your OS takes control of the printers that are connected to the computer, and the materials that need to be printed.<br>
                </li><li>User interface: Also referred to as a UI, this is the part of the OS that allows a user to enter and receive information. This can be done with typed commands, code, and other formats. <br>
