        <br><br> How Many Operating Systems Are There? <br><br>
For the most part, the IT industry largely focuses on the top five OSs, including Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, Google’s Android OS, Linux Operating System, and Apple iOS. But that’s just the tip of the operating system iceberg. There are numerous free OS options in addition to Linux including Chrome OS, Syllable, and ReactOS, which was initially launched as a Windows95 clone. 
But that’s just in the world of personal computers, mobile devices, and tablets. When you examine server OSs, the number jumps considerably. All told, there are over 63 base proprietary OSs with various versions or updates, in addition to another 26 non-proprietary OSs.
As tech continues to advance, and as younger generations like millennials grow up with technology and move to the workforce, the need for technology in business settings will only grow. Younger generations are fueling the features and applications that operating systems provide for personal and business use. If you’re considering a degree in IT, now is the time to start. A future career in computers or IT will provide you with plenty of job opportunities, industries, and endless possibilities.
