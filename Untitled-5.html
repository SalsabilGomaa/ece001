    <p>What Are Some Examples of Operating Systems? <br><br>
Some examples of operating systems include Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, Google’s Android OS, Linux Operating System, and Apple iOS. Apple macOS is found on Apple personal computers such as the Apple Macbook, Apple Macbook Pro and Apple Macbook Air. Microsoft Windows is found on a variety of personal computer platforms from brands such as HP, Dell, and Microsoft itself. Linux is an open source OS that can be modified by users, unlike those from Apple or Microsoft. Though it started out being used for personal computers, usage has since expanded to phones and other smart devices, servers, gaming, and more.
Android is a Unix-like mobile operating system that you’ll find on your mobile phone or tablet, depending on the device brand. Similarly, Apple iOS is found on Apple mobile devices such as an iPhone (though it previously ran on Apple iOS, iPad now has its own OS called iPad OS).
<br><br> Mobile vs. Computer <br><br>
So why are there different types of operating systems for mobile tech and computers? There are several reasons a single system doesn’t work perfectly for both. Computer and mobile OSs are different because they’re developed for different uses.
Computer systems have to store lots of complex data, have a different user interface, and need to be prepared for printing, removable disks, and more. They feature a desktop and a control panel for users to manage all of their information. Computer operating systems are also older, and therefore more familiar to the IT industry; they’ve been around much longer than phones that utilize operating systems.
Mobile phones don't feature a desktop that's the same as a computer desktop. Their user interface is much more about simple moves—things you can do with your fingers or voice—so it’s designed to offer a simpler interface. There are many resources to help users learn more about operating mobile phone systems, as they're very different from computer systems.
Touch screen user interfaces, smartphones, and mobile devices are everywhere and part of life, and need operating systems. If you’re considering a career in IT, you probably know that the technology is continuing to grow and develop, and there will be plenty of opportunities for the future.
